A detective investigates the disappearance of a female colleague who was investigating a famous porn film director. It appears that the local mafia has taken control of the pornographic film industry controlled by Pleasure Lady P*ssy", a mysterious porn actress who some believe is the incarnation of Pornocrates. We are in the middle of the '80s, in a place full of criminals, prostitutes, drug dealers, and pimps. This famous director hides something important that needs to be found. We still don't know what it is. However, we know that she is watched by a famous gang that controls the city's prostitution market: Strip clubs, brothels, suspicious bars, and practically every type of pornographic film production distributed in Europe and North America. The adventure will begin inside the first location that will be investigated: the first detective's office. There are several tracks to follow in this place. The most obvious clues are on several VHS tapes scattered and hidden around the place. In them, there are a series of amateur and professional images of sexually explicit content. However, it will be necessary to explore and investigate each of the VHS tapes to discover the first secret that will drive this investigation. The office is very important. However, you will need tools that will actually help you move forward. For that, it will be necessary to visit the hideout of a famous Hacker, one of the first to invade the local telephone system. With all the information gathered, you can now find the Orgiflix nightclub's secret entrance somewhere in the old Asian quarter. Watch out! The place is guarded and protected by the local mafia. But who is VHS Pussy? Who is this porn film director that arouses the interest, devotion, and hatred of so many people? Some believe she is the reincarnation of the queen of lust known as Pornocrates. She easily manages to dodge the police and rival drug dealers. She even controls the City Mayor's cock. Yes. VHS Pussy is very dangerous! She knows how to use her pussy, brain, and body to dominate anyone... male or female. This game is based on Félicien Rops's painting: A woman in profile, haughty, dressed only in black stockings adorned with a vertical row of pink and red flowers, held up by blue garters, long black gloves, golden bracelets, a wide golden belt with a big blue bow, a blue necklace, blue earrings, a black feathered hat, two white roses in her hair and a white veil headband. The woman can be seen as a powerful female and your hog. The pig with a golden tail can also be seen as an allegory for luxury. 'Pornography is purely and simply a description of carnal pleasures; eroticism is the same revalued description, based on an idea of love or social life. Everything that is erotic is also necessarily pornographic' ~ Self-definition of Queen Pornocrates. Playing is extremely easy because you can use your computer's keyboard and mouse or you can choose a joystick. This is an easy-to-use first-person game: The player controls the character in a 3D environment filled with clues that can be read and objects that can be collected. The game has features that allow you to watch VHS tapes and check CCTV cameras. These elements will be very important for the development of the game. The game has several NPCs. There are armed enemies who will do anything to protect the VHS nightclub. They have mysterious interests that the user will need to discover. During the game you can: Collect items are hidden in the detective's office, the retro hacker's hideout, and the famous VHS nightclub. Protect yourself using all sorts of weapons available (Glock, shotgun," axes). Read messages and save them in inventory to review later. There are two goals to achieve: Know what happened to the previous detective.
